ðŸ”– CheckConsecutiveVowels

In this coding challenge, I wrote a program that takes a string and checks if it contains consecutive vowels or not. It should give Positive as an output if it contains consecutive vowels and Negative otherwise. For example saetqi string contains a adjacent to e, which means that it contains consecutive vowels. So it should give Positive as an output. On the other hand, if you take the string of statoqag, the output should be Negative.

ðŸ”– ConvertMillisec

In this coding challenge, I wrote a program that converts the given milliseconds into hours, minutes, and seconds. The program should convert only from milliseconds to hours/minutes/seconds, not vice versa and during the conversion following notes should be taken into consideration.

ðŸ”– ConvertNumToRomanNum

In this coding challenge, I wrote a program that converts the given number (between 1 and 3999) to the roman numerals. The program should convert only from numbers to Roman numerals, not vice versa and during the conversion following notes should be taken into consideration.
